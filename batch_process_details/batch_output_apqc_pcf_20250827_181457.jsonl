Tier 3 = High risk/high investment with full reviews).\n\n4) Establish Standards, Policies, and Templates\n- Policies: documentation minimums, approval thresholds, risk thresholds, exceptions handling, independence of reviews, conflict of interest, experimentation ethics.\n- Templates: business model canvas, lean business case, risk assessment, DPIA/PIA, compliance checklist, architecture impact, financial model, experiment plan, go-live checklist, PIR report, retirement plan.\n- Define SLAs: e.g., pre-screen 3 business days; pilot approval 10 business days; funding decision within 30 days.\n\n5) Build the Model Register and Tooling\n- Implement a single source of truth (register) capturing ID, owner, status, tier, markets, KPIs, risk rating, approvals, documents, review dates, and retirement plans.\n- Configure workflow in BPM/PPM tools for intake, reviews, approvals, and audit trails.\n- Set up dashboards for pipeline, cycle times, portfolio balance, and value realization.\n\n6) Integrate Risk, Compliance, and Architecture\n- Align with ERM risk taxonomy; define mandatory assessments by tier.\n- Embed legal/compliance/privacy checkpoints and approvals.\n- Include architecture/data standards and tech guardrails; require exceptions to be time-bound with remediation plans.\n\n7) Funding and Portfolio Alignment\n- Define thresholds and authorities (e.g., Board approves >$X; BU head approves Tier 1).\n- Establish prioritization criteria (strategic fit, NPV/ROI, risk-adjusted value, capacity).\n- Implement portfolio balance targets (core/adjacent/transformational; region; customer segment).\n\n8) Capability Enablement and Change Management\n- Train roles on process, tools, and templates; publish a playbook.\n- Onboard model owners and stewards; run clinics/office hours.\n- Communication plan: why, how, benefits; feedback channels.\n\n9) Pilot and Refine\n- Run a limited pilot with representative models across tiers.\n- Collect feedback, measure SLAs, and adjust criteria, templates, and cadences.\n- Formalize go/no-go to scale.\n\n10) Rollout and Operate\n- Enforce \u201cno model outside the register\u201d policy.\n- Run cadenced reviews, approvals, and exception processes.\n- Track benefits and risks; trigger interventions when thresholds breached.\n\n11) Monitor, Audit, and Improve\n- Quarterly continuous improvement review; update standards.\n- Annual independent audit; remediate findings with owners and deadlines.\n- Retrospectives after major launches and retirements;

publish RACI; embed accountability in performance objectives.\n- Shadow initiatives bypassing governance\n  - Solution: Funding policy requires registration; portfolio transparency; executive sponsorship to enforce.\n- Tool and template sprawl\n  - Solution: Standardize on a small toolset; maintain a template library; sunset duplicates.\n- Lack of skills to produce quality submissions\n  - Solution: Training, office hours, exemplars, coaching; steward role to assist owners.\n- Misaligned incentives (launch over value)\n  - Solution: Tie incentives to value realization, compliance, and customer outcomes, not just go-live.\n- Weak integration with risk/compliance\n  - Solution: Embed early risk screening; standing risk panel; joint KPIs for timeliness and quality.\n- Global vs local tensions\n  - Solution: Global standards with local addenda; delegated authority with alignment checks.\n- Change fatigue and resistance\n  - Solution: Clear \u201cwhy,\u201d incremental rollout, feedback loops, visible wins, champion network.\n\n## Performance Metrics (KPIs)\nCoverage and compliance:\n- % of in-scope models in the register\n- % models following tiered lifecycle as designed\n- # and severity of audit findings;
